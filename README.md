# DawnsburyCharacterManager

## What is this?
A simple character manager for [Dawnsbury Days](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693730/Dawnsbury_Days/), a turn-based RPG by Dawnsbury Studios that's based on the Pathfinder 2e combat system.
Some friends and I wanted to share our characters easily, so I built this tool. Maybe it can help you too!

## Where do I download it?
It's in the releases section over there on the right! I know github UI is pretty esoteric, though, so you can also just [click here](https://github.com/Choojermelon/DawnsburyCharacterManager/releases)!

## This is cool! Can I say hi?
Check out my [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/chuji.bsky.social), hit me up on Discord (@chuji), or if you're feeling extra nice,
[here's my Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/chuji)!

## How do I use it?
Let's take a look at the UI!
